# Simple Recorderjs

This is a simple HTML5/JS program that uses [Recorder.js](https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs) to record audio in a browser and save those as .wav files on a server.

The work is here is based on [simple-recorderjs-demo](https://github.com/addpipe/simple-recorderjs-demo) by [addpipe](https://github.com/addpipe). Many modifications were done by [ajaswa](https://github.com/ajaswa).

You can read more about Pipe's original project [here](https://blog.addpipe.com/using-recorder-js-to-capture-wav-audio-in-your-html5-web-site/) and try a live demo of their code [here](https://addpipe.com/simple-recorderjs-demo/).

Note that this repo is not a library or template for use in your own website. For that, please start with the original [simple-recorderjs-demo](https://github.com/addpipe/simple-recorderjs-demo) project. Rather, this is a collection of pages and JavaScript code used in my own data collection projects. Please feel free to look at them as examples.

### License

No idea right now--trying to figure out what simple-recorderjs-demo was released under first before I ascribe a license to this project. So, please keep that in mind before using this code in your project.
