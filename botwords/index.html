        <h1>BotWords</h1>
        <p>Thank you for helping out! Just follow the directions below to submit snippets of your voice. These will be used in a machine learning project to make robots respond to specific phrases.</p>
        <h3>What Are You Making?</h3>
        <p>I am working on a number of things that I would like to respond to <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnHymel/status/1273768365014822917">someone shouting "Hadouken!"</a> I am also collaborating with a few of my friends to give voice recognition to their companion bot projects.</p>

        <p>Jorvon Moss (<a href="https://twitter.com/Odd_Jayy/media">@Odd_Jayy</a>) is working on a number of companion bots. In particular, he is making a <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Odd_Jayy/widget-dragon-companion-bot-83c0c0">dragon</a>. I'll let you guess what happens when someone says "dracarys."</p>

        <p>Alex Glow (<a href="https://twitter.com/glowascii">@glowascii</a>) has her owl familiar, <a href="https://www.hackster.io/glowascii/archimedes-the-ai-robot-owl-325ff5">Archimedes</a>, as well as a new fennec fox named "Fenrir." She would like both of these bots to respond to a variety of words (including their names).</p>

        <h3>How to Participate</h3>
        <p>Just follow these steps! Please try to make each recording with no background noise, if possible.</p>
        <p>1. We have several different words or phrases that we'd like you to say. Under each phrase, press the <b>Record</b> button and say the word or phrase. Accept any pop-ups that ask you to use your computer/phone's microphone. Note that timing is sometimes off, as it might take a fraction of a second to actually begin recording. Take look at the browser tab or phone's notification bar: you should see a recording symbol when recording is actually happening.</p>
        <p>2. Please make several recordings of each word/phrase using different inflections! It will help the training process.</p>
        <p>3. Play back each recording to make sure that the word or phrase is easily understood (and not truncated).</p>
        <p>4. For each word or phrase recording that you are happy with, click the <b>Upload to server</b> link next to it.</b></p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>License</h3>
        <p>By uploading your voice, you're giving me consent to use it in an aggregate fashion as part of a machine learning exercise. They will only be used as part of a personal project for non-commercial purposes. Code for the project will be open source and available on GitHub.</p>
        <p>Audio recordings will be labeled with non-identifying information (so people won't know who is speaking). All recordings will be bundled and available as a .zip file for anyone to download to use in their machine learning projects, similar to the <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html">Google Speech Commands dataset</a>.</p>
